We've got a basic bookstore! We're ready to add a new feature required by our users -- the ability to update our books and delete them from our inventory.


## Database Setup

Full SQL for adding all the books can be found in the database.sql file. 

- [ ] Create a database - check `book.js` for the name
- [ ] Run Queries found in `database.sql` for your starting data

## Base Mode

- [ ] DELETE & PUT AJAX calls
- [ ] Clear form on submit 
- [ ] DELETE & PUT SERVER SIDE 
- [ ] Page should refresh with up to date data after a DELETE or PUT

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Add publisher & year -- you'll have to change many things across the full stack!
- [ ] Improve the styling of the page -- Bootstrap & CSS
    - [ ] Center the header, table, on the page
    - [ ] Give alternating rows difference in color
    - [ ] Make the buttons more UX friendly -- Red for delete, etc. Bootstrap makes this easy!
    - [ ] Give Labels to the input boxes
    - [ ] Give the form its own area on the page -- make it distinct from the table
    - [ ] Maeke the page responsive -- Bootstrap Containers will be helpful!
- [ ] Add validation to your form
- [ ] Change the sort order
